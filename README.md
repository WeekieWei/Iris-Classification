## Training Dataset
The Dataset is taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Running Environment
The program has been compiled and exported into a MATLAB standalone application. Which means your computer only requires MATLAB runtime installed to run the program but not the full MATLAB software.

## Project Implementation
- Neural Network
- Programming Technique(To integrate the network model into user friendly classification program)

## Editor's Words
I was really enjoyed when I was developing the program. I firstly tried to train a neural network by feeding the network with a bunch of data, but the performance was not going really well, until I figured out to use a different learning algorithm which improves the model by a lot. I did not stop when I have succesfully trained the model, I could feed the network with new data to see what output I could get (programatically), but it was not easy especially for others who do not know MATLAB programming language, so I decided to try if I could take the trained model and develop a more user friendly input method, and I made it! It was glad to know we can always apply something we have learned in the past to create something better.
